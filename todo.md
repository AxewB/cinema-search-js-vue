- [x] accept filters by pressing "Enter" key, or after delay

- [ ] export film list object to another file and import it in filmstore.js

- [x] fix filtration by year in bookmarks --- actually it wasn't working anywhere, 'cause `year` was exporting like string when user input data manually, not using dropdown list
